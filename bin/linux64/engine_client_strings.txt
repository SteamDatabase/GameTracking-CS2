As the clock offset goes from cl_clock_correction_adjustment_min_offset to this value (in milliseconds), it moves towards applying cl_clock_correction_adjustment_max_amount of adjustment. That way, the response is small when the offset is small.

If # frames is -1, then it will average all the remaining frames in the vprof file.
If 1, recovers when the stream is exhausted when playing PCM sounds (prevents music or ambiance sounds to stop if too many sounds are played). Set to 0, to stop the sound otherwise.
If 1, spews allocations on the static alloc pool. Set to 0 for no spew.
If 1, spews warnings when the buffer is exhausted (recommended). Set to 0 for no spew (for debugging purpose only).
If connected with available split screen slots, connects a split screen player to this machine.
If current and target volumes are close, don't cross-fade.
If enabled, channel will drop client when sending too much data causes buffer overrun
If enabled, hides all surfaces which have been painted.
If non-zero when a map loads, static props won't be loaded
If nonzero, aggressively cull duplicate sounds during mixing. The number specifies the number of duplicates allowed to be played.
If running a game, outputs the precache manifest for the current level
If set then include this secret when doing UDP logging (will use 0x53 as packet type, not usual 0x52)
If set to 1, does an optimization to prevent extra SendTable_Encode calls.
If set to 1, report all sound formats.
If set to 1, report all sounds played with S_StartSound(). The sound may not end up being played (if error occurred for example). Use snd_showstart to see the sounds that are really played.
If set to 1, report all sounds stopped with S_StopSound().
If set to 1, report all sounds that just looped.
If set to 1, report more error found when playing sounds.
If set to 1, server IPs will be hidden in the console (except when you type 'status')
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set to 1, the server records data needed to replay network stream from bot's perspective
If set to 1, the server will force all client files except the whitelisted ones (in pure_server_whitelist.txt) to match the server's files. 
If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files. Otherwise, it will issue a warning to the client.
If set to 1, the server will print a message whenever a client is verifying a CRC for a file.
If set to 1, uses the last known leaf visibility data for visualization.  If set to 0, updates based on camera movement.
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it's empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, server only simulates entities on even numbered ticks.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the server uptime exceeds this number of hours, the server will exit.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the server uptime is less than this number of hours, the server will continue running regardless of sv_memlimit.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the clock offset is less than this amount (in milliseconds), then no clock correction is applied.
If this is nonzero, then the texture list panel will render thumbnails of currently-loaded textures.
If this is nonzero, then the texture list panel will show all currently-loaded textures.
If true use Steam to record voice (not the engine codec)
If true when log when a query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
