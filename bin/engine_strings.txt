*** A special note about internal error number 1007 ***Experience suggests that a common cause of i.e. 1007is unreliable memory or other hardware.  The 1007 assertionjust happens to cross-check the results of huge numbers ofmemory reads/writes, and so acts (unintendedly) as a stresstest of your memory system.I suggest the following: try compressing the file again,possibly monitoring progress in detail with the -vv flag.* If the error cannot be reproduced, and/or happens at different  points in compression, you may have a flaky memory system.  Try a memory-test program.  I have used Memtest86  (www.memtest86.com).  At the time of writing it is free (GPLd).  Memtest86 tests memory much more thorougly than your BIOSs  power-on test, and may find failures that the BIOS doesn't.* If the error can be repeatably reproduced, this is a bug in  bzip2, and I would very much like to hear about it.  Please  let me know, and, ideally, save a copy of the file causing the  problem -- without which I will be unable to investigate it.

Extension conflicts with extension already in database: extend
Extension factory's GetPrototype() returned NULL for extension:
Extension number $0 has already been used in "$1" by extension "$2".
Extension numbers cannot be greater than $0.
Extension numbers must be positive integers.
Extension range $0 to $1 includes field "$2" ($3).
Extension range $0 to $1 overlaps with already-defined range $2 to $3.
Extension range end number must be greater than start number.
Extensions of MessageSets must be optional messages.
Extensions to non-lite types can only be declared in non-lite files.  Note that you cannot extend a non-lite type to contain a lite type, but the reverse is allowed.

If # frames is -1, then it will average all the remaining frames in the vprof file.
If enabled, channel will drop client when sending too much data causes buffer overrun
If enabled, hides all surfaces which have been painted.
If non-zero when a map loads, static props won't be loaded
If set then include this secret when doing UDP logging (will use 0x53 as packet type, not usual 0x52)
If set to 1, clients may load non-vpk files from pure protected directories.
If set to 1, does an optimization to prevent extra SendTable_Encode calls.
If set to 1, server IPs will be hidden in the console (except when you type 'status')
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set to 1, the server records data needed to replay network stream from bot's perspective
If set to 1, the server will allow clients to play if files they loaded are missing on server, otherwise treat client as file mismatch.
If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files. Otherwise, it will issue a warning to the client.
If set to 1, the server will print a message whenever a client is verifying a CRC for a file.
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it's empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, server only simulates entities on even numbered ticks.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the server uptime exceeds this number of hours, the server will exit.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the server uptime is less than this number of hours, the server will continue running regardless of sv_memlimit.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the clock offset is less than this amount (in milliseconds), then no clock correction is applied.
