// This file contains a list of the different classes of equipment "Rebuy" will buy for you.
// The rebuy system takes a snapshot of all the equipment you have when you buy something.
// That includes issuing a buy alias command, buying something from the buy menu,
// or after using Autobuy (see autobuy.txt for details).
//
// When the rebuy command is issued, it attempts to buy all the equipment that you
// had when the last snapshot of your equipment was taken. The equipment will be
// purchased in order as specified in this file.  You can modify the list in this file to suit
// your play style in case you become short on money and can't afford all
// the equipment you had in the previous round.
