	//NOTE: you can use "cl_quickinventory_filename [myRadialSettingsFile.txt]" to use a different 
	//filename in this folder to store your QuickInventory settings, and avoid this one being 
	//overwritten when clients update. Start with a copy of this file for best results.	

	//====== TOP_SLOT  ======//
	//Use "TOP_SLOT" to define the slot you would like to center at the top of the screen. 
	//The radial will rotate to place that slot at the top of the screen.
	//Use any Valid Slot Name (see below) to define this.
	//Comment out "TOP_SLOT" altogether to simply start the segments at 0 degrees (north), meaning it won't be centered.

	// E.G
	//TOP_SLOT	UTILITY  //Picks the center of all utility slots to be placed north.
	//TOP_SLOT	RIFLE //Puts the primary weapon at the top of the radial

	TOP_SLOT	GRENADES

	//====== ROTATION_OFFSET ======//
	//Add additional rotation (in degrees) to the entire radial. 
	//Note that this is in addition to the rotation applied due to "TOP_SLOT" (if defined)

	ROTATION_OFFSET		0.0

	//====== RADIAL CONTENTS ======//
	// Place slots/weapons in the order you want them to show up, progressing clockwise.
	// Segments start at 0.0 degrees (i.e. 12 o'clock) if TOP_SLOT not defined, and there is no ROTATION_OFFSET
