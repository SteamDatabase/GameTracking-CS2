// [Forrest] Default sound volume to halfway.  It seemed way too loud on Xbox at full blast.
// Halfway feels comfortable to me.  I set my headphones volume so that the dashboard blips as the selection
// felt normal to me.  At halfway, gunshots felt satisfying but not overwhelming and footsteps were still
// clearly audible.
// $TODO: We should probably calibrate our default audio level more scientifically than this.
// $TODO: We'll eventually want the options menu to save the user's volume level, in which case we will
// probably need to remove the setting here.
