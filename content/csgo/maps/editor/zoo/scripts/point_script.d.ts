/**
 * This file, `point_script.d.ts`, documents the JavaScript API for cs_script scripts attached to point_script entities.
 * This file is a TypeScript Declaration file. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html#dts-files
 * This file can be used by various editors to provide tooling while editing JavaScript. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html 
 * Next to this file is a `tsconfig.json` file configured for editing JavaScript targetting the current version used by CS2.
 * Place copies of these two files, `point_script.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json`, next to your scripts and some editors will begin providing tooling without further configuration.
 * These two files will be maintained as the cs_script API changes or the JavaScript version in CS2 is updated.
 * Please send feedback to CSGOTeamFeedback@valvesoftware.com with "cs_script Feedback" in the subject line.

/**
 * `"cs_script/point_script"` is the module provided to scripts loaded for point_script entities.
 * 
 * # Setup:
 * - Create a JavaScript file (.js) that imports this module.
 *      - See `hello.js` for an example.
 * - Create a point_script entity in your map and set its cs_script field to reference your JavaScript file as a vjs asset.
 *      - See `script_zoo.vmap`. There is a point_script entity in there named "hello_cs_script" that runs `hello.js`. There are a handful of other examples as well.
 * 
 * # Execution:
 * - The compiled version of your script (.vjs_c) will be loaded during map load.
 * - When the point_script entity is spawned it will execute all code at the top level scope of your script.
 * - Register callbacks on `Instance` to setup code that executes at various times throughout the lifetime of the map.
 *      - A function passed to `Instance.OnActivate` will be invoked when the point_script entity is activated.
 *      - A function passed to `Instance.OnPlayerJump` will be invoked when any player in the map jumps.
 *
 * # Tips:
 * - Entity variables are stable. Two variables referring to the same entity will be reference equals (===).
 * - Extra values attached to an entity variable will still be there if the variable is fetched again.
 * - A map can have multiple point_script entities. Each script will run with its own Instance, set of globals, and set of entity variables.
 * 
 * # Tools Mode:
 * - In tools mode, saving changes to your script will recompile your file, clear all registered callbacks, and re-run the top level scope of your script.
 * - Global variables and instances of entity variables will persist across reloads.
 *      - Beware. This is an avenue for holding references to code from previous iterations of your script. This is only a concern in tools mode.
 * - See `Instance.OnScriptReload` for a tool to handle edge cases around reloading.
