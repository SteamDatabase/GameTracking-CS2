0: Use normals reconstructed from depth. 1: Output correct normals in z prepass.
0: run all send jobs on main thread; 1: send jobs run asynchronously (except on dedicated server); 2: send jobs asynchronously; 3: send jobs run in parallel but block to not overlap the next tick; 4: main server clients' send jobs run in parallel, then HLTV server jobs; this approximately matches pre-async profile for a single HLTV server configuration

Deseret
Desired command queue length on the server, used to avoid command queue starvation due to packet loss.  The effective value is the smaller of this value and cl_interp_ratio, hence the large default value.  This value, multiplied by the tick interval, is added to cl_tickpacket_recvmargin_desired to obtain the effective desired recv margin.

If a server frame takes longer than N ms, complain about it.  (Dedicated server only.)  See also engine_enable_frametime_warnings.
If in replay, jumps back to live
If non-zero, client binds port to specific address.  Usually you should leave this blank to use a different random system-assigned port for each connection.
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set to 1, the server will force all client files except the whitelisted ones (in pure_server_whitelist.txt) to match the server's files. 
If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files. Otherwise, it will issue a warning to the client.
If set to 1, the server will print a message whenever a client is verifying a CRC for a file.
If set to 2, the server will force all client files to come from Steam (and it will not load pure_server_whitelist.txt).
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it's empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the binding doesn't work and you're not using a US English keyboard, you should try:
If the clock offset is less than this amount (in milliseconds), then no clock correction is applied.
If true when log when a query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
If true, resets the input device when there was a long enough hitch between callbacks.

When connecting to local listen server (for example, using the 'map' command), default to loopback=false, which connects to '127.0.0.1' instead of 'loopback'.  This uses the network stack so that fake lag/loss can be simulated.
When enabled, changes in tv_enable convars cause immediate startup or shutdown of hltv server
When enabled, game server will quit immediately via syscall instead of running host states shutdown sequence
When enabled, this allows for entity packing to use the property changes for building up the data. This is many times faster, but can be disabled for error checking.
When enabled, this will collect all information for relay sending into a single datagram to ensure that the data stays together through a potentially large number of relays
When enabled, this will use a uniquely generated server code to authenticate relay connections. This code is coordinated via the GC or some external means rather than by clients directly
When enabled, this will use a uniquely generated server code to authenticate relay to relay connections. This code is coordinated via the GC or some external means rather than by clients directly
When encoding entity deltas, append on a random number of extra bytes.  This happens after sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_min_size.
When encoding entity deltas, if the delta size is < N bytes, then shove in N dummy bytes.  This happens before sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_extra_min/sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_extra_max
When encoding entity deltas, instead of unreliably deducing explicit deletions, actually send list of existing but not networked entities (dont_transmit list) to each client.
When r_low_latency is enabled, this moves the low latency sleep on tick frames to happen after client simulation.
When receiving packets out of sequence, wait this many seconds for missing sequences to arrive
