		"CSGO_Item_Desc_HKP2000"											"Accurate and controllable, the German-made P2000 is a serviceable first-round pistol that works best against unarmored opponents."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_AK47"												"Powerful and reliable, the AK-47 is one of the most popular assault rifles in the world. It is most deadly in short, controlled bursts of fire."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Glock18"											"The Glock 18 is a serviceable first-round pistol that works best against unarmored opponents and is capable of firing three-round bursts."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_DesertEagle"										"As expensive as it is powerful, the Desert Eagle is an iconic pistol that is difficult to master but surprisingly accurate at long range."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Elites"												"Firing two large-mag Berettas at once will lower accuracy and increase load times. On the bright side, you'll get to fire two large-mag Berettas at once."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_FiveSeven"											"Highly accurate and armor-piercing, the pricy Five-Seven is a slow-loader that compensates with a generous 20-round magazine and forgiving recoil."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_P250"												"A low-recoil firearm with a high rate of fire, the P250 is a relatively inexpensive choice against armored opponents."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_CZ75a"												"A fully automatic variant of the CZ75, the CZ75-Auto is the ideal short-term choice for turning the tables and gaining your opponents weapon. But with very little ammo in the magazine, strong trigger discipline is required."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Tec9"												"An ideal pistol for the Terrorist on the move, the Tec-9 is lethal in close quarters and features a high magazine capacity."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Taser"												"Perfect for close-range ambushes and enclosed area encounters, the single-shot x27 Zeus is capable of incapacitating an enemy in a single hit."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Bizon"												"The Bizon SMG is low-damage, but offers a uniquely designed high-capacity drum magazine that reloads quickly."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Mac10"												"Essentially a box that bullets come out of, the MAC-10 SMG boasts a high rate of fire, with poor spread accuracy and high recoil as trade-offs."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_MP7"												"Versatile but expensive, the German-made MP7 SMG is the perfect choice for high-impact close-range combat."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_MP5SD"												"Often imitated but never equaled, the iconic MP5 is perhaps the most versatile and popular SMG in the world. This SD variant features an integrated silencer, making an already formidable weapon whisper-quiet."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_MP9"												"Manufactured in Switzerland, the cutting-edge MP9 SMG is an ergonomic polymer weapon favored by private security firms."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_P90"												"Easily recognizable for its unique bullpup design, the P90 is a great weapon to shoot on the move due to its high-capacity magazine and low recoil."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_UMP45"												"The misunderstood middle child of the SMG family, the UMP45's small magazine is the only drawback to an otherwise versatile close-quarters automatic."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Aug"												"Powerful and accurate, the AUG scoped assault rifle compensates for its long reload times with low spread and a high rate of fire."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_GalilAR"											"A less expensive option among the terrorist-exclusive assault rifles, the Galil AR is a serviceable weapon in medium to long-range combat."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Famas"												"A cheap option for cash-strapped players, the FAMAS effectively fills the niche between more expensive rifles and the less-effective SMGs."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_M4A4"												"More accurate but less damaging than its AK-47 counterpart, the M4A4 is the full-auto assault rifle of choice for CTs."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_SG553"												"The terrorist-exclusive SG553 is a premium scoped alternative to the AK47 for effective long-range engagement."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_AWP"												"High risk and high reward, the infamous AWP is recognizable by its signature report and one-shot, one-kill policy."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_G3SG1"												"The pricy G3SG1 lowers movement speed considerably but compensates with a higher rate of fire than other sniper rifles."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_SCAR20"												"The SCAR-20 is a semi-automatic sniper rifle that trades a high rate of fire and powerful long-distance damage for sluggish movement speed and big price tag."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_SSG08"												"The SSG08 bolt-action is a low-damage but very cost-effective sniper rifle, making it a smart choice for early-round long-range marksmanship."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Mag7"												"The CT-exclusive Mag-7 delivers a devastating amount of damage at close range. Its rapid magazine-style reloads make it a great tactical choice."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Nova"												"The Nova's rock-bottom price tag makes it a great ambush weapon for a cash-strapped team."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_SawedOff"											"The classic Sawed-Off deals very heavy close-range damage, but with its low accuracy, high spread and slow rate of fire, you'd better kill what you hit."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_XM1014"												"The XM1014 is a powerful fully automatic shotgun that justifies its heftier price tag with the ability to paint a room with lead fast."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_M249"												"A strong open-area LMG, the M249 is the perfect choice for players willing to trade a slow fire rate for increased accuracy and a high ammo capacity."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Negev"												"The Negev is a beast that can keep the enemy at bay with its pin-point supressive fire, provided you have the luxury of time to gain control over it."

		"CSGO_Item_Desc_C4"													"Stable and resistant to most physical shocks, this improvised plastic explosive has a detonation velocity of over 8,000 meters per second when ignited."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_HE_Grenade"											"The high explosive fragmentation grenade administers high damage through a wide area, making it ideal for clearing out hostile rooms."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Flashbang"											"The non-lethal flashbang grenade temporarily blinds anybody within its concussive blast, making it perfect for flushing out closed-in areas. Its loud explosion also temporarily masks the sound of footsteps."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Smoke_Grenade"										"The smoke grenade creates a medium-area smoke screen. It can effectively hide your team from snipers, or even just create a useful distraction."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Decoy_Grenade"										"When thrown, the decoy grenade emulates the sound of the most powerful weapon you are carrying, creating the illusion of additional supporting forces."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Diversion"											"When thrown, the diversion device will highlight sectors on tablets, creating the illusion of additional enemies."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Frag_Grenade"										"The experimental fragmentation grenade can output extreme amounts of highly explosive damage in a wider area, making it ideal for both attacking and defensive strategies."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Firebomb"											"The Fire Bomb is a powerful experimental weapon that bursts into high-temperature flames when thrown on the ground, chemically burning any player in its wide spread radius."

		"CSGO_Item_desc_Knife_T"											"Quiet and always available, the knife has a fast, low-damage primary attack and a slow, high-damage secondary attack. A backstab will earn quiet players an instant kill."
		"CSGO_Item_desc_Knife_Ghost"										"Ghosts love ghost knives. When they get their hands on one, look out! They'll try stab you first chance they get. Too bad they are a ghost and ghost knives can't hurt people...."
		"CSGO_Item_desc_m4a1_silencer"								"With a smaller magazine than its unmuffled counterpart, the silenced M4A1 provides quieter shots with less recoil and better accuracy."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_usp_silencer"										"A fan favorite from Counter-Strike Source, the Silenced USP Pistol has a detachable silencer that gives shots less recoil while suppressing attention-getting noise."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Revolver"				"The R8 Revolver delivers a highly accurate and powerful round at the expense of a lengthy trigger-pull. Firing rapidly by fanning the hammer may be the best option when point-blank stopping power is required."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Bayonet"			"Relatively unchanged in its design since World War II, the bayonet still retains a place in modern military strategy. Bayonet charges have continued to be effective as recently as the second Gulf War and the war in Afghanistan."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Flip"				"Flip knives sport a Persian-style back-swept blade with an acute point.  While the point itself may be fragile, the overall design of the flip knife's design is surprisingly durable."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Gut"				"The most notable feature of a gut knife is the gut hook on the spine of the blade.  Originally popularized as an aid for field dressing game, the gut hook is also effective at  cutting through fibrous materials like rope, webbing, or safety belts with ease."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_CSS"				"A classic of the Counter-Strike series, the edge of this knife is press-fit Stellite perfectly held in place due to its precise fit with the titanium on the blade's cheek and spine. The handle is fossilized mastodon ivory held in a carbon fibre pocket." 
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_KnifeM9"				"This is the M-9 bayonet.  Originally intended to be mounted on a rifle, it is also well suited to close-quarters combat."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Karam"			"With its curved blade mimicking a tiger's claw, the karambit was developed as part of the southeast Asian martial discipline of silat. The knife is typically used with a reverse grip, with the finger ring on the index finger."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_KnifeTactical"			"A knife designed for modern tactical uses, the blade is well suited for a range of both combat and utilitarian needs.  The unique Tanto point allows for maximum penetration through even the toughest of surfaces." 
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Butterfly"		"This is a custom-designed balisong, commonly known as a butterfly knife. The defining characteristic of this weapon is the fan-like opening of a freely pivoting blade, allowing rapid deployment or concealment. As a result, butterfly knives are outlawed in many countries."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Knife_Falchion_Advanced" "A modern homage to a falchion sword, this clip point blade has a curved edge."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_knife_push" 			"Designed for efficient brutality, using a push dagger is as simple as throwing a punch or two."

		"CSGO_Item_Desc_knife_gypsy_jackknife"	"This marble-enamel-handled flip knife conceals a small but viciously tapered blade."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_knife_stiletto"			"Historically a focal point of contention and even regulation, this Italian-style stiletto switchblade knife features a spring-loaded blade that can be deployed almost instantly with the push of a release catch."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_knife_skeleton"			"This skeletonized-tang knife has been taped at the handle for improved grip. The hole allows a finger to be threaded through for stability and safety."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_knife_kukri"			"Used in traditional rituals, such as weddings or stabbings."

		"CSGO_Item_desc_Axe"					"Heavy and always available, the axe has a sharp side and a dull side. Swing it for low-damage primary attack or throw it for a high-damage secondary attack. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?"
		"CSGO_Item_desc_Hammer"					"The hammer is available for fixing things and breaking things. Swing it for low-damage primary attack or throw it for a high-damage secondary attack. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
		"CSGO_Item_desc_Spanner"				"A wrench is typically used to apply torque when turning objects, but you can hit anything with it for low-damage primary attack or throw it for a high-damage secondary attack. Bringing a wrench to a firefight is a recipe for screwing up."

// Mission Objectives

	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_501"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Hello, my name is Sebastien Hennequet, and I'll be your CO for Operation Bloodhound.  Our purpose? Track down one of the most dangerous operators working for The Phoenix.  Under my training you will become more than a soldier... you'll become a hunter.   But before we begin our work with a rifle, you have to learn how to live long enough to get one. Become an expert with your sidearm, it's the fastest way to get the resources you'll need."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_502"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Until he betrayed us all, Chase Turner was a decorated member of the Coalition Taskforce.  It's suicide to engage him one on one, but with the right coordination we can kill him before he knows he's in your crosshairs.  The AWP is reliable and deadly, and the first tool of the trade you need to master."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_503"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Despite what Lt. Sabri may think, our victory depends on teamwork, not individual performance.  You're not alone out there: so even if you can't get a kill shot, sometimes wounding the enemy can be enough to tip the scales.  Use the SSG08 to support your allies."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_504"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Since aligning himself with Valeria, Turner does whatever he can to keep us off balance... forcing us to panic and lose focus.  But precision is the hallmark of a great operator... it's easy to wield an Aug like a cudgel, but can you use it as a scalpel?"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_505"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We've launched 5 unsuccessful attempts on Turners life... he evaded us twice by using bad intel to trap us: if that happens to you, you need to be prepared for anything."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_510"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The success or failure of our missions hinge on brief moments: looking around the right corner... pulling the trigger at the right time...  I'm giving you three shots to kill your target... you should need only one."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_511"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: It's graduation day.  We've identified the location of Sergei, one of Valeria's low ranking lieutenants.  Find him.  Kill him...and prove to me that you're ready to hunt Turner."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_512"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We received word that Turner's terrorist cell has mobilized, this our last chance for weapons training before we go on the hunt."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_513"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: This doesn't make any sense... The Phoenix are raiding Season, but that target doesn't fit in Turner's MO... the target's not political, and the battlefield is too claustrophobic. Be careful when you're leaving bombsite A... there a ladder that leads you to a perfect sniping roost: Turner might be waiting for you."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_514"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's greatest blow against us came when he assassinated Lord William, one of the Coalition Taskforce's biggest political and financial supporters.   By holding control of a tower he was able to pick off every operator we sent to Rescue Lord William... we can never let history repeat itself."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_515"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We noticed Phoenix activity at an abandoned rail yard... be careful as you secure the area: It may look like you're surrounded by cover but there are plenty of places that overlook the yard, particularly at bombsite B."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_516"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We tracked Turner's men to a shopping district the Maghreb region: tread softly when moving down side alleys to bombsite B.  There's a house with excellent visibility where Turner's men can plan an ambush. "
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_517"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner knows we're getting close: he's making a move on various soft targets all around the globe... he wants to use these hostage scenarios to divide the Coalition's resources and pick us off one at a time."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_506"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The man we hunt is Chase Turner.  He was a friend to many of us, and a protégé of mine... the most gifted sniper I ever trained.  Valeria's words have twisted him beyond recognition, and when the time comes it will fall on us to put him down.  Let's begin your training with the SSG08."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_507"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: There's a reason why the AWP is the bread and butter for many a marksman.  I've seen firsthand how one pull of the trigger can change the world... perfect your aim, and you might do the same one day."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_508"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Let's see if you have the discipline to learn what Lt. Sabri couldn't.  Not all precision instruments come with a scope. In the right hands, a Desert Eagle is still effective at long range and is a fraction of the cost of an AWP.  And as you know... early success can shape the rest of the battle."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_509"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We can't always control the terms of a skirmish, and the unfortunate reality of war is that rifles aren't cheap.  If Turner comes for you, you might not have your preferred rifle, and if that happens you have to be prepared to use whatever is on hand."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_518"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Before Turner became a traitor he was a world class operator.  With his instincts and ability to control sightlines he was once able to single handedly stop a terrorist plot to destroy the bay area zoo.  The way he told the story, he said he was able to kill The Phoenix and enjoy a dolphin show at the same time."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_519"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The seeds of Turner's betrayal began after a routine operation in the Maghreb region.  Valeria's agents were looking to bomb a shopping district, and we moved to stop them.  He must have killed a dozen men from the palace interior, but after the skirmish he came home changed... Valeria had reached out to him: and he was swayed by her silver tongue."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_520"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's forces are bearing down on you.  Remember your training and use the AWP to control the bombsite. It's just the two of you out there, so be smart and cover each other's backs. "
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Valeria sent Turner on a mission to prove his devotion to the cause - the hijacking and transport of weapons grade plutonium.  One of his favorite tactics was taking control of offices overlooking the train yard, converting them to effective sniper's nests."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_522"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: His place in The Phoenix secured, Turner spearheaded an assault on one of Lord William's estates... the battle was long and brutal.   Turner raced to hold control of a tower on the property, holding off our forces while his new allies sought to complete their mission.  In the end we failed: Lord William was dead."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_523"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We sought Turner out more aggressively, but it didn't matter: he didn't just have knowledge of our tactics... he knew how to exploit every operator leading the Taskforce.  He launched a plot to kill Kotaro Izaki... using his hatred of Elliott Kingsman to lure him to the Season Corporation."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_524"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The death of Lord William sent ripples across Europe.  Soon Anarchists spouting the propaganda of The Phoenix took to the streets.  The only reason we held them off was because we were able to maintain the upper park."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_525"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Our last encounter with Turner was our most chilling.  He was using the rafters at bombsite B to pick us off one by one.  We drove them off... but not before they were able to destroy information regarding their cell: all we know for sure is that The Phoenix are preparing to hit a new civilian target."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_526"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: This is the moment we've been waiting for:  We've confirmed that Turner is among the operators at this hostage situation. If you see him in the engagement, don't hesitate to take him out."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521_new"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's cell is licking its wounds, but we can't afford to be complacent.  It's time for another weapons training exercise... when Turner peeks his head out, we'll be ready to take it off."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_526_new"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's men are spreading across the Maghreb, looking to destroy villages that are unsympathetic to The Phoenix's cause.  In order to protect these people, we need to split up.  Take another operator and guard the bombsite.  Remember, this isn't a standard mission: do not. Leave. The bombsite."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_527"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: In the field we always have to reassess our surroundings and improvise.  This exercise is about not relying on Coalition resources... take out the enemy, then use their own weapons against them."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_528"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: I received word that your transport chopper was shot down over the Maghreb.  Evac is coming, but it's going to take time.  The two of you can survive this, just stick together and remember what I've taught you."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_529"						"<b>Booth</b>: So you're the operator everyone's all in a fuss about.  I'm sure helping out Mr. Hennequet on his vengeance quest is fun, but if you're interested in being more than an old man's catspaw, we should talk.  The name's Booth... and I'm always looking for talented individuals to make money with."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_530"						"<b>Booth</b>: What do you say we do a little Zen exercise?  While you're on the field, hunt some chickens for me.  Naturally I'm sure you're wondering why I'd ask for something so ludicrous.  Maybe I'm looking for you to test my wares... perhaps I'm judging how well you follow instructions... or maybe I just really hate chickens.  Either way, do what I ask and you will be rewarded."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_531"						"<b>Booth</b>: As much as I like to believe that people respect my business practices, the reality is that I sell guns to people who like to use them.... And eventually they might want to use them on me.  Show me that you can take whatever the world throws at you, and let the bodies of your enemies tell the story of your victory.   Do this... and I will happily put you on retainer."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_531_turner"					"<b>Booth</b>: Chase Turner was a man of conviction and talent... it's a shame that you killed him.  But there's no point in dwelling on the past, we need to move forward.  Killing Turner puts you into a very special tier of operators... and I have a special task for someone with your skillset."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_502_Turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Until he betrayed us all, Chase Turner was a decorated member of the Coalition Taskforce.  Seeing as you're the one who put him down... it's only fitting you carry on his legacy with the AWP."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_504_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: There's someone I'd like to meet, a defector from the Coalition Taskforce named Chase Turner.  But before you do, I have a final test for you.  Stand with your new brothers and sisters against your old ones... don't let our hostages be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_505_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: With Turner dead, you can bet Valeria will be looking for vengeance... being able to adapt will be key to your survival."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_512_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner may be dead, but his cell is still out there.   We must stay vigilant and keep our skills sharp."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_513_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The Phoenix are raiding the Season Corporation, we need to deploy now!"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_516_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: An anonymous tip reported Phoenix activity in a small town in the Maghreb.  Something about this doesn't feel right... be careful when moving down the side alleys... there may be an ambush."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_517_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The Phoenix are making a move on various soft targets all around the globe... get out there and save those hostages!"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_506_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Chase Turner was a friend to many of us, and a protégé of mine... I take no joy in his death, but he had to be put down.  Ah, we mustn't dwell in the past... but look towards the future."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_509_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We can't always control the terms of a skirmish, and the unfortunate reality of war is that rifles aren't cheap.  If Valeria comes for you, you might not have your preferred rifle, and if that happens you have to be prepared to use whatever is on hand."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_520_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Phoenix forces are bearing down on you.  Remember your training and use the AWP to control the bombsite.  It's just the two of you out there, so be smart and cover each other's backs."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521_new_turner"				"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's cell is licking it's wounds, but we can't afford to be complacent.  It's time for another weapons training exercise..."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_525_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We once encountered Turner in a compound like this one... He was using the rafters at bombsite B to pick us off one by one.  We drove them off... but not before they were able to destroy information regarding their cell: all we know for sure is that the Phoenix are preparing to hit a new civilian target."



	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_Two_Sides_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Evil.  Criminal.  Terrorist.  The reality is that I am none of these things.   My name is Valeria Jenner, and I am the voice of The Phoenix... and The Phoenix... is the voice of freedom.  It's said that you have talents that can be of use to The Struggle.   It's time for you to prove you have the skills you claim to have.  "
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_spark_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: You're not the first person whose eyes were opened to the hypocrisy that surrounds us.  To understand that for freedom to truly reign,  we must burn down governments.  Burn down religion.  Burn down the bourgeoisie... and only from those ashes can mankind rise pure and clean.  It's your turn to follow the path of The Phoenix... it's your turn to light the spark of revolution."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_Flames_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Fire is the weapon of the revolution.   Like us, fire breathes.  Like us, fire spreads.  Yes it takes lives, but without fire we would sit in darkness and die in the cold.  Do not be afraid of fire... master it."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_tyrants_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We fight to unseat tyrants with resources superior to our own.  That's why we need to leverage surprise; striking fast and hard.   Lie in wait with your shotgun... then act decisively."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_booth_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Like it or not, the Arms Dealer named Booth plays a pivotal role in The Struggle.  Yes, he plays both sides but without his wares we wouldn't be able to topple tyrants.  Work with him.  Use him.  But never trust him."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_meet_mentor_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: There's someone I'd like you to meet, a defector from the Coalition Taskforce named Chase Turner.  But before you do, I have a final test for you.  Stand with your new brothers and sisters against your old ones... don't let our hostages be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_labels_turner"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The media loves to label everything.  Civilian Casualties... Military Casualties... when the reality is that a life is a life.  Everyone on this Earth plays a role in The Struggle... and we all are culpable for our actions.  The men and women we capture are not random people, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They are targeted for a reason... and we must never let them be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_dead_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Turner is dead.  Struck down by a father who couldn't bear to see his son outshine him.  A reckoning will be coming for Mr. Hennequet... but for now I want him to hurt like we do.  I've located one of his star pupils, an operator named Jackson.  Find him.  Kill him.  And bring justice for The Phoenix."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_loyalty_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Your loyalty has been proven... and now The Phoenix has special need of you.   A nuclear facility we aim to take over has recently remodeled its toxic room.  I'm sending you and a fellow brother to secure the engineers responsible for the re-design.  We need to know what changes are coming."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_resources_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We never know what resources we'll have available in the field, so it's important to be able to fight with a variety of weapons... not just the ones you're familiar with."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_conflict_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Some conflicts feel never ending.  The same dance that continues over and over.  Lesser men look to this and see futility, but The Phoenix sees hope.  As long as people are willing to die for what they believe is right, the cause is not lost.  We are not defined by our failures until the moment we refuse to stand back up."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_role_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Turner played an important role in The Struggle, and it now falls on you to walk in his footsteps.  Master the AWP... carry on a great man's legacy."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_message_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The world is not yet ready for our message, but that doesn't mean our message does not need to be spread.  In time, fear will give way to understanding, and The Phoenix will be regarded as the heroes we are."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_pollock_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Comparing Javier and Turner's technique is like comparing  Pollock and  Kandinsky ... both are masters, but one is significantly more messy.  Not every assassination calls for a bloodbath.  When I call on you, I expect your kills to be clean and precise."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_blunt_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Marcus Chapel is Sebastien Hennequet's best friend.  Loyal. Courageous.  And an expert marksman.  He's also insanely predictable which is why I was able to lure him here. Stalk him and end his life... so that Hennequet will live out the rest of his in sorrow and misery."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_smg_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The Phoenix has no need of cowards.  Often our victories hinge on relentless aggression... that's where SMGs come in.   Light enough to move swiftly, but a fast enough rate of fire to keep our enemies pinned down."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_knife_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: If you want to fight for change, there's  something I need you to do.  Kill a man with a knife.  Feel his blood on your hands,  Do not ignore it,  Do not sugar coat it,  Accept it.  For The Phoenix does not lie... not to the sleeping world... nor to ourselves."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_open_house_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Booth is hosting another one of his open houses... go and try out his wares... there may be a weapon you've overlooked that could suit you."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_rebirth_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The Phoenix is the symbol of rebirth... every skirmish we engage in, whether it is our fifth or our fiftieth is a new beginning.  Seize that opportunity and strike our oppressors down... then break their morale by turning their own weapons against them."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_underhill_turner_sub"				"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: People want to believe that change comes from within the system, but you and I both know better.  The system protects corporate stooges like Underhill and Murphy as they line their pockets promoting industries that cripple the common man.  Today their ivory tower begins to fall."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_maghreb_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Felix launched a campaign against us in the Maghreb... Operation Vanguard he called it.  It was a killing field.  One by one Turner executed our brothers and sisters as they valiantly tried to place an explosive device.  It was in that moment a question took root in his mind.  What cause could motivate these people to throw their lives away with such determination.  He sought me out... and I provided answers."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_bank_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: I don't know how, but Felix learned about our bank heist and his jack-booted thugs are en route.  It falls on you two to steel your resolve and cut the oppressors down."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_fruitless_turner_sub"				"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We have shown the world that the struggle is not fruitless... now anarchists have spread throughout Europe... eager to break the government's gilded cage."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_fear_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Fear is a construct of the mind, and it's something our enemies wield with alarming grace.  You see; when people are scared, they turn to those with authority for solutions, because they're conditioned to feel powerless. That's why engaging with nuclear options is critical: Once we show that the ivory tower can do nothing to save them...they will rise to help themselves."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_elysee_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Titans of industry all flocked to the Elysee resort - a temple of excess designed to coddle CEOs who made their fortunes on the backs of laborers.  They'd laugh as they clinked glasses full champagne... each flute filled with one month's salary of their employees.  But soon they would stop laughing."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_history_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: History may be written by the victors, but that doesn't mean we have to buy the book.  We lost the battle in Maghreb, but we gained the loyalty of Turner.  Now, Turner is dead, but we have gained you.  The Coalition believes that they've struck a blow against us, but like the story of Turner's defection, like the story of our namesake... defeat is never the end.  The Phoenix can never die."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_cobble_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The capture of Lord William is one of The Phoenix's greatest triumphs.  Turner lead a small unit to William's estate,  dragging that sniveling worm out from his ivory tower.  The Coalition Taskforce tried in vain to save him... but Turner laid them low with the SSG08."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_journalist_turner_sub"				"<b>Chase Turner</b>: That journalist we captured during operation Vanguard seems to have more friends we thought.  Our safehouse has been compromised, and Felix's thugs are coming in force.  Support isn't coming.  It's up to you two to hold the line."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_intro"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Nice to meet you, I'm Chase Turner.   I wish I had time to give a fancy speech but we got a problem.  Sebastien Hennequet has sent an Operator named Jackson to assassinate Valeria. Nothing is more important than her survival."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_headshot"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Our battles are fought in the streets.  In businesses.  In people's homes.  And for that reason it's critical that when we send a bullet downfield it hits its intended target.  We're not butchers.  We're surgeons."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_prodigy"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Before I became a freedom fighter I was a sniper... trained by the best.  Sebastien called me a prodigy, but I'm not so sure that being able to reliably kill a man who doesn't even know you're there is something to be proud of... regardless, the skills I learned have kept me alive.   When securing Underhill and Murphy, be sure to maintain sightlines on the room with the metal detector... you're asking to be flanked if you don't."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_hero"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: I hate this part of the world... too many bad memories.  Back when I was in the Taskforce they heralded me as a hero because I was able to hold bombsite A single handedly. Hero...  I just posted up by some barrels with good visibility and killed anyone with the courage to think for themselves.  I was no hero... I was a monster."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_cobble"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Lord William was one of the major backers of the Coalition Taskforce, but his money was as dirty as it came.  Abducting William was easy.  Waiting for evac... now that was the hard part."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_chaos"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: We're trained at a young age that chaos is wrong.  That we need order for society to survive... but the reality is that order doesn't serve the common man... order serves those in power.  The ones that get to tell people's children to fight their battles... who impose their laws and faith unto others for a nebulous greater good with impossible standards.  It's a con job.  We shouldn't fear people thinking for themselves."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_valeria"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: When Valeria first asked me to steal nuclear materials, I balked: if I was wrong about her... if my trust was misplaced.... I would be giving a mad woman the ability to kill millions.  But my faith was rewarded.  Valeria doesn't want to destroy world.  She wants to save it."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_underhill"					"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Underhill and Murphy is gathering their clients for an all-paid bacchanal at the Elysee Resort.  Those men and women care about profit margins, not people... but soon they won't be rewarded for their avarice."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_shame"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: I'm ashamed of the things that I've done in the name of my country... but I can't wallow in that misery.  All I can do now is try to change the world for the better.  And yes, our new world will be built atop the bodies of the fallen but change isn't easy.  We aren't fighting soldiers... we aren't fighting peace keepers... we're fighting learned helplessness.  And when this sleeping world awakes... it will thank us."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_blunt"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Well, we must be doing something right... The Taskforce is sending a top notch sniper to kill us.  Chapel trained with me under Sebastien Hennequet; he's one the best... but it won't be good enough.  Find him and put him down before he does the same to you."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_booth"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Someone sold us out, and now a simple bank job's about to turn into a standoff.  Hang tight.  I'm bringing a cell to pull you and your partner out.  I'm not leaving one of our own behind."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_journalist"					"<b>Chase Turner</b>: When I defected during Operation Vanguard, I took something with me... a journalist named Alex Kincaide.  We thought Kincaide was secure at one of our safehouses but the Coalition Taskforce has compromised the location.  Valeria needs that journalist.  Take a friend for backup and make sure no one touches Kincaide."
	"op_bloodhound_turner_AWP"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Hennequet was wrong about a lot of things, but had one thing right: one bullet can change the world.  I want you to get comfortable with the AWP.  Yes it's expensive, but sniper rifles don't come more blue chip.  Let's stick with the basics here... Rome wasn't built in a day."	
	"op_bloodhound_booth_Spend_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: I've been waiting for you... Valeria said she was sending someone new to pick up her latest shipment of goodies.  I'm dying to see what you're going to buy for her."
	"op_bloodhound_booth_flash_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: Flashbangs are wonderful little things:   They can buy you time for an escape or they can create an opportunity for a kill... and fortunately for you, I happen to have a surplus I'm dying to unload."
	"op_bloodhound_booth_bomb_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: A farmer would never plant a seed and walk away.  No... he nurtures his crops,  protecting them from being nicked by nasty little creatures.  So it is with plastic explosives.  Show me that you can be a reliable demolitionist, and you'll be rewarded."

	"op07_subtitle_701"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Operation Bloodhound was a success.  Turner is dead, and the Phoenix are still recovering from their loss.  Now is the time to put on the pressure… to hit multiple Phoenix operations at once… to spread like wildfire.  My name is Major Felix Riley, and together we're going to stop Valeria."
	"op07_subtitle_702"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Ladies and Gentlemen, the Phoenix have occupied a cruise ship and it falls on us to stop them.  Remember, just because you're engaging enemies on the lido deck doesn't mean there's time for short-poured mai tais.  Good luck."
	"op07_subtitle_703"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The Phoenix have dug into the ship and are holding hostages.  I want every passenger, every crew member, every second rate entertainer accounted for.  I won't stand for another Vanguard incident."

	"op07_subtitle_708"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Jungle Warfare has always been chaotic, and this exercise will be no exception."			
	"op07_subtitle_709"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Valeria didn't send her goons to Italy for a gelato run.  Find them and eliminate them."
	"op07_subtitle_710"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  One of Booth's rivals has set up shop underneath Empire Taxi's fleet garage.  We can't let the Phoenix gain control of the compound."

	"op07_subtitle_712"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  A sniper rifle in the right hands can entirely change the direction of a battle… it's Sebastien's weapon of choice."	
	"op07_subtitle_713"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  These are the least expensive assault rifles you can buy: they're not flashy, but they're perfect for an Operator on a budget."
	"op07_subtitle_714"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Stop the Phoenix: and reclaim Santorini for its people."
	"op07_subtitle_715"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  In the wake of Turners death, maintaining our marksman advantage over the Phoenix is imperative."
	"op07_subtitle_716"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  A quaint Dutch village has turned into a battleground: protect the village and stop The Phoenix."	
	"op07_subtitle_717"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Time to see how you handle CQC scenarios."			
	"op07_subtitle_718"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  With the exception of us controlling the weapons you'll be using, this is about as close to the real thing as you're going to get."
	"op07_subtitle_719"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  This is the heart of what we do.  The Phoenix will stop at nothing to plant their explosives… we have to be as committed to defusing them."
	"op07_subtitle_720"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  A disoriented enemy is an enemy that is not murdering you or your teammates.  Get proficient with flashbangs, and use them to gain position on your opponents."
	"op07_subtitle_721"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Some people, like Sebastien, like to keep their distance… some people, like Kotaro, like to be up close and personal… this exercise is more up Kotaro's alley."	
	"op07_subtitle_722"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Take on the role of sniper, and give your team the support they need.  Be patient and precise… your fellow operators are counting on you."
	"op07_subtitle_723"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  You're a part of a team… if you need something and don't have enough money, don't be afraid to ask your allies to provide you with a weapon."
	"op07_subtitle_724"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  If you want to fight the Phoenix, you need to learn how to think like them.  Their strategies are always evolving, and ours should follow suit."
	"op07_subtitle_725"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Molotovs are a great way to lock down an area and control enemy movement, so get used to carrying petrol in a beer bottle."
	"op07_subtitle_726"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  If you want to survive, it's important that you look to your team for support when you need it.  Use an ally's weapon to stop The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_727"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The pistol can be a challenging weapon, but if you can master it you will be able to get an early advantage on your opponents."
	"op07_subtitle_728"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Time to put together everything you've learned: good luck, and make us all proud."	
	"op07_subtitle_729"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  We don't always have the luxury of buying the weapons we want… use whatever weapon you can find."

We work in pairs, relying on teamwork to take out overwhelming force.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Let's see what you got."
	"op07_subtitle_802"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Felix likes to trumpet the success of Operation Bloodhound, but he still has egg on his face after Alex Kincaide got captured during Vanguard.  Once we get you two up to speed we're going to clean up his mess."
	"op07_subtitle_803"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  When we go after Kincaide you'll have very little support in the field… get comfortable with using the weapons of our enemies against them."
	"op07_subtitle_804"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Alex Kincaide has been a Phoenix captive since Operation Vanguard…. that ends today.  It took months, but I was able to get intel on Kincaide's location: a cement factory owned by industrialist and Phoenix sympathizer Franz Kriegeld.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Get in the factory, and extract Kincaide - once he's safe we'll find a way to nail Kriegeld."	
	"op07_subtitle_805"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  Franz and Valeria would argue all the time; but one thing they both agreed on was that the Empire Taxi Company had to go - I don't know what a bunch of New York cabbies did to piss off The Phoenix, but they're going to hit there next."
	"op07_subtitle_806"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  In one of our interviews, Valeria told me The Phoenix weren't finished destroying Lord William's legacy - they're looking to attack all of his estates."
	"op07_subtitle_807"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  Kriegeld is wielding The Phoenix like a sword, using them to target industries that he's competing with."
	"op07_subtitle_808"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Great job extracting Kincaide, Carmen couldn't have done it better.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Now that he's safe: let's focus on Kriegeld.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  We'll get to that… I had something else in mind."			
	"op07_subtitle_809"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Now I may be mistaken, but you strike me as an enterprising individual with an eye for opportunity... The name's Booth, and I think we can help each other out.  You need guns for your war, and I need money for single malt scotch.  If you showcase some of my weapons on the battlefield I'll make sure something nice falls off the truck for you."
	"op07_subtitle_810"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Conflict has been around ever since the first caveman learned how to pick up a rock... it's human nature that drives us to war.  And seeing as you can't fight human nature it seems like I might as well make a little money out of it, right?  <i>Right</i>."
	"op07_subtitle_811"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  My source just informed me of another Operation being spearheaded by some of Valeria's hired thugs.  Let's move."
	"op07_subtitle_812"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Kotaro, Felix wants to talk to us…\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  It can wait.  There's still work to do."
	"op07_subtitle_813"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Some bleeding hearts question the ethics of arming two sides of the same conflict but people like you and me understand the way the world works.  There are no <i>good guys</i> and <i>bad guys</i>, everyone is a hero in their own story.  Don't get me wrong, I don't subscribe to that whole load of bollocks that Valeria Jenner is peddling; but at the end of the day it's a bit like having a great aunt that pinches your cheeks every time you see her.  Does she annoy the piss out of you?  Yes.  Do you turn down her birthday present?  Fuck no."
	"op07_subtitle_814"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Kotaro, I need your people stateside: we have an opportunity to catch Kriegeld red handed.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  But sir, we're just starting to see results here in Europe, I need more ti-\n\n<b>Felix Riley:</b> After you finish this op you're going back to the States…that's an order Kotaro.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b> Yes sir."
	"op07_subtitle_815"							"<b>Booth:</b>  If you're feeling any pangs of guilt about working with me I wouldn't worry too much about it.  People in our lines of work don't tend to live long, so I say just enjoy the ride as long as you can."
	"op07_subtitle_816"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  We just got the full debrief from Kincaide.  Franz Kriegeld is using his business as a front to help finance the Phoenix... but if we're going to start freezing his assets we're going to need proof.  I don't like sending you back into the lion's den, but this is our chance to deal some lasting damage to The Phoenix."

	"op07_subtitle_818"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  I still think this is a terrible idea.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  It's for posterity.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  It's for our court martial. \n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Just say your damn name.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  *sigh* I'm Carmen Cocinero\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  and I'm Kotaro Izaki.  In the event that we fail, this recording is proof that we are operating as individuals, not as sanctioned members of the Coalition Taskforce.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  But we wouldn't mind a pardon…\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Carmen...\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  <i>I</i> wouldn't mind a pardon."
	"op07_subtitle_819"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Carmen and Kotaro may be AWOL, but our focus can't change: we need to stop The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_820"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The financials you stole from Kriegeld aren't just going to help us freeze his assets… they're a road map for future Phoenix Operations."
	"op07_subtitle_821"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  We're getting close to Kingsman: I can feel it.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Kotaro:  they're baiting us… Kingsman didn't show at the last two jobs… it's a trap.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Of course it's a trap - but someone has to be there to spring it.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  This is insane.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  You're free to go whenever you want Carmen.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  No… we're in this together."	
	"op07_subtitle_822"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  We just received word that Valeria is en route to the cement factory:  Finish up your business in the Maghreb and return to the states: this could be our best chance to take her out."
	"op07_subtitle_823"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Hello again, it's your old friend Booth.  Now obviously as a businessman I make it a point not to choose sides, and as such I would never reveal critical information to either the Coalition Taskforce or The Phoenix.  My daughter however, does not seem to share my love of discretion and is now marked for death by Valeria.  Again, it would be inappropriate of me to interfere or ask for any favors; however, I imagine if you helped extract Imogen from the Phoenix base she is now hiding in, she would be quite grateful for your assistance."
	"op07_subtitle_824"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Thank you for saving me… I owe you, and I always repay my debts.  Now, a little birdie told me Valeria survived our fireworks show, but her blood is in the water and sharks are circling.  Different cells are stepping up activity to prove that they are strong enough to lead The Phoenix.  You push back these splinter groups, and The Phoenix will remain leaderless until Valeria recovers."
	"op07_subtitle_825"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Franz Kriegeld was Valeria's heir apparent - it's his money that helped finance the operation and he felt he should be in charge… however now that his assets are being frozen he's looking to prove he has other skills that are useful to The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_826"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  While Valeria recovers, it falls on Naomi to maintain the status quo and show that the powerbase of The Phoenix has not eroded.  She's a zealot who truly believes in her cause."
	"op07_subtitle_827"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Since Turner's death, Valeria had sought to find his replacement… she found him in Mikha Biton: a mossad operative who has crossed over to The Phoenix.  He's still a relative unknown, but there's few things more dangerous than someone looking to prove themselves."

	"op08_subtitle_901"								"<b>Rona Sabri:</b> Alright, first stop: Austria.  Felix will probably tell you there's no time for sightseeing... that's why you're going to use a P90 and throw as much copper down field as you can.  The sooner you can kill the bad guys, the sooner you can get a quiche at Hotel Post."

	"op08_subtitle_902"								"<b>Rona Sabri:</b> Okay, lets see what's next... shotgun training.  I'll be honest, shotguns were always more of Kotaro's thing, so I don't have a whole lot to offer in terms of combat advice, but I will say this: next time you go on leave, don't text your CO at 3AM explaining why you deserve a promotion.  It is the road that leads to desk duty."

Also important: if you bring me back some prosecco I will owe you big time.  I mean sure, it's contraband but if you get caught what's the worst that can happen, a court-martial? You know, on second thought, skip the prosecco."

The Phoenix have been dormant for about a year, which while good for the world at large, has been a real drag for me personally because you know I like shooting them.  Fortunately, it looks like Valeria's merry band of psychopaths is back in business, and that means so are we.  Felix will be coordinating the ops on the ground, and I've been asked slash told to be on briefing duty until I learn some humility.  I got my coffee, some mission briefings, and a text from Felix saying if I screw this up I'll be looking for work, so I'd say we're ready to go.  Welcome to operation Hydra… I'll try to not get you killed."

        "CSGO_Customplayer_tm_jungle_raider_variante_Desc"    "A notorious rebel and brilliant improviser, Vypa is one of twelve sisters born into poverty and left to fend for themselves at the age of seven. Vypa's solo attacks against her country's military dictatorship were so prolific the military assumed her work was the result of a small team of people. At one point, Vypa mistook a remote Guerrilla Warfare (GW) training ground for a government outpost. Shortly after invoking one of her infamous 'sting and choke' maneuvers on the camp she realized her mistake, but not before she had Capt. Crasswater tied up to a tree and threatened at knife point. Impressed and a little frightened, Crasswater recruited Vypa and her sisters into the GW. Together they now lead all jungle-based GW missions and 'government awareness' campaigns. \n\n<i>Don't worry, it's just me.</i>"

		"CSGO_PickEm_Rules_Body"		"<b>Welcome to The Cologne 2014 Pick'Em Challenge!</b>\n\nYour goal is to score as many points as possible by correctly picking the winning teams as the tournament progresses. There are a total of 100 points to score and a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Pick'Em Challenge Trophy will be awarded for scoring 25, 50, or 75 points, respectively. Pick'Em Challenge Trophies are badges that are displayable on your CS:GO avatar and on your Steam profile. In addition to winning a trophy you can compete with your friends on the Pick'Em Friends Leaderboard.\n\nEach day of the event provides an opportunity to score 25 points: 24 for correct picks and 1 just for playing.\n\nTo make a pick during any stage of the tournament, you must own an unused sticker for the picked team. You can get stickers from ESL One Cologne 2014 Sticker capsules or from the Steam Community Market.\n\nA single team sticker is sufficient for picking that team multiple times throughout the event.\n\nUsing a team sticker to make a pick will lock the sticker for the day. It will not be usable or tradable until the next day. Undoing a pick will not unlock the sticker. It will still be unusable and untradable until the event day is complete. Once the event day is complete, locked stickers will unlock and be usable and tradable.\n\nDay 1 ( Aug 14th ) Pick the winner of each of eight group stage matches. Each correct pick is worth 3 points.\nDay 2 ( Aug 15th ) Pick the eight teams that will advance to the quarterfinals. Each correct pick is worth 3 points.\nDay 3 ( Aug 16th ) Pick the four teams that will advance to the semifinals. Each correct pick is worth 6 points.\nDay 4 ( Aug 17th ) Pick the two teams that will advance to the grand finals and the one team that will win the grand finals. Each correct pick is worth 8 points.\n\nOn each day you can earn an additional point just for playing.\n\nTrophies will be awarded after the tournament is complete."

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_IntroductionContents"			"<font size='24'>THE GAME MODES</font><br/>Counter-Strike has four basic game modes: Classic Casual, Classic Competitive, Arms Race, and Demolition. <br/><br/><font size='30'>CLASSIC</font><br/>The two Classic modes share the same basic rules. Games are played on either Hostage or Bomb maps.  In both types of maps, a single match is divided into multiple timed rounds.  Your team wins a round by eliminating all members of the opposing team or by completing map objectives. In Hostage maps, Counter-Terrorists try to locate hostages and carry them to an rescue zone.  Terrorists must prevent the hostages from being rescued.  For either team, harming hostages decreases your score and reduces the money available for purchasing weapons and equipment in the next round. In Bomb maps, the Terrorists try to plant and detonate a bomb at one of two bomb sites.  The Counter-Terrorists must prevent the bomb from being planted or defuse it once it is planted at a bomb site. <br/><br/>The two classic modes differ in four major ways. In competitive mode, Friendly Fire is on, Team Collision is on, you must purchase Armor and Defuse kits (you get them automatically in Casual), and matches last thirty rounds rather than ten.<br/><br/><font size='30'>ARMS RACE</font><br/> Arms Race takes place in a single round, and unlike the other three modes, dead players respawn instantly. Upon respawn, you're invulnerable for five seconds or until you attack. Weapons and equipment aren't purchasable in Arms Race. Instead, everyone starts with the same weapon, and you receive a new weapon for every enemy you kill. The final weapon you earn is a golden knife, and the first player to make a kill with the golden knife wins the game. <br/><br/><font size='30'>DEMOLITION</font><br/>Demolition mode is a fast-paced hybrid of the Classic and Arms Race game rules.  It consists of two multi-round matches.  At the end of the first match, the teams switch sides. A team wins a round by either eliminating the enemy team or by detonating or defusing the bomb.  Weapons and equipment are not purchasable. Instead, if you eliminate an enemy, you receive a new weapon at the beginning of the next round. You also earn bonus grenades for each additional kill you make beyond the first in a single round. The team with the most rounds won wins the match."

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_ClassicLabel"					"Classic Rules"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_ClassicContents"				"<font size='24'>WINNING</font><br/>A Classic match is made up of timed rounds. There are two ways to win a round: complete your team's map objective or eliminate all enemy players. The first team to win a majority of rounds wins the match.<br/><br/><font size='30'>BUYING GEAR</font><br/>You begin a match with some basic equipment and a set amount of money. Each round within a match starts in a Buy Zone where you have the opportunity to purchase equipment. The amount of time available to make purchases lasts 45 seconds; after that, there's no opportunity to buy equipment until the beginning of the next round.<br/><br/><font size='30'>EARNING MONEY</font><br/>Players earn money by killing enemies, achieving mission objectives, and winning rounds. Shooting teammates and hostages reduces your payout.<br/><br/><font size='30'>DYING AND SPECTATING</font><br/>There is no way to gain additional health. Once your health indicator reaches zero, you're dead until the next round starts. When you die, you lose all of the gear you have purchased. While dead and waiting for the next round to start, you can watch the game from the point of view of other players and take control of any of your team's bots.<br/><br/><font size='30'>RESCUING HOSTAGES</font><br/>If you're a Counter-Terrorist, your goal in Hostage maps is to extract hostages. To do this, move close to each hostage and press ${+use} to make them follow you, then lead them to a rescue zone. Rescue zones are marked with an H on the Mini Map. They're also identified by the hostage rescue zone icon <img src = 'hud_hostage_zone_icon.png' width='24' height='24'/> that appears in the upper left corner of the HUD when you're inside the zone. When all hostages have been escorted to a rescue zone then the Counter-Terrorists win the round. Either team can win by eliminating all members of the opposing team. If all hostages have been killed, the round can only be won through team elimination. Players on either team lose money and score for injuring or killing hostages.<br/><br/><font size='30'>PLANTING AND DEFUSING THE BOMB</font><br/>Bomb maps require the Terrorist team to plant and detonate a bomb. The Counter-Terrorist team must stop them. A randomly chosen Terrorist is assigned to carry the bomb. If you have the bomb, you will see the bomb carrier icon <img src = 'c4_inventory.png' width='24' height='24'/>in your HUD and on the scoreboard next to your name. Deliver it to either of two bomb sites and plant it. Bomb sites are labeled A and B. Signs scattered throughout the map will help you find the sites. A and B markers also appear in the Mini Map Radar. A flashing bomb icon <img src = 'hud_bombzone.png' width='24' height='24'/>appears on the HUD when you're at a bomb site. Press the Use ${+use} button to plant the bomb, and then prevent the Counter-Terrorists from defusing it. Counter-Terrorists win by eliminating all Terrorists or by defusing the bomb. To defuse a bomb, stand near it and hold ${+use} until you see a message saying that the bomb has been defused. If you have a Defuse Kit, you'll see the Defuse Kit icon <img src = 'hud_defuser.png' width='24' height='24'/> in your HUD and in the scoreboard next to your name. The Defuse Kit will speed up the defusing process, but is not required to defuse a bomb.<br/>"

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_Tactics"						"Tactics"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_TacticsContents"				"<font size='24'>ACCURACY</font><br/>Like real weapons, Counter-Strike weapons recoil when they are fired. The longer a fully automatic weapon is fired, the more inaccurate it will become. It will return to its normal accuracy shortly after you stop firing. Moving while firing decreases your accuracy, and jumping reduces the accuracy even more.<br/><br/><font size='24'>WEAPON SWAPPING</font><br/>in the two Classic modes, dead players drop their weapons. To swap your weapon for one on the ground, aim at the dropped weapon and press ${+use}. Alternately, you can drop your current weapon by pressing ${drop} and then simply walk over the desired weapon.<br/><br/><font size='24'>HEADSHOTS</font><br/>Headshots do much more damage than shots to the body. You can often kill an enemy with one well-placed shot to the head.<br/><br/><font size='24'>BEING A TEAM PLAYER</font><br/>Teams that work well together as a unit win more.  When you are playing with other people, use headsets to communicate and coordinate with your team members.  Assign roles and duties.  You can monitor player status on the Scoreboard screen and the in-game mini-scoreboard.  Pay attention to the Notification Area in the upper right corner and the Mini Map in the upper left corner of your screen. The Notification Area will display a dead player's name and who killed them.  The Mini Map will briefly display where a teammate was killed.<br/><br/><font size='24'>LEARN THE MAPS</font><br/>Explore the maps offline against bots.  Get to know each map, and all of its routes and ambush spots. When playing against humans, take advantage of the Spectate mode to observe how other players navigate the maps.<br/><br/><font size='24'>USE YOUR GRENADES</font><br/>All types of grenades are useful.  HE grenades can flush out enemies.  Smoke grenades create cover from sniper fire. Flashbangs temporarily blind and deafen enemies, making it very difficult for them to accurately target you.  Molotov cocktails and Incendiary grenades can create a flaming barrier to entry or exit points.  Decoy grenades produce team specific noise to confuse your opponents, and even affect the enemy's Mini Map display.<br/><br/><font size='24'>KEEP MOVING</font><br/>Constant movement will make you a difficult target.  Movement while in crouch and walking states is useful when attempting to ambush an enemy or assuming a sniper role.<br/><br/><font size='24'>MIX UP YOUR TACTICS</font><br/>Do not go back to the well too often.  If you continue to follow your same course of action because it worked great once, assume that your earlier victims will catch on and be waiting for you to pull the same tactic the next round.<br/><br/><font size='24'>OBJECTIVE UNDER GUARD</font><br/>When defusing or planting the bomb or approaching the hostages, check to make sure an enemy isn't waiting nearby to ambush you.<br/><br/><font size='24'>RELOAD OFTEN</font><br/>Reload often.  If you run out of ammo in the middle of a firefight, switch to your other weapons instead of trying to reload exposed and under fire.<br/><br/><font size='24'>STEALTH</font><br/>Stealth is vitally important in Counter-Strike. When a player runs, their footsteps can be heard. To prevent this, switch to walk mode by pressing ${+speed} when trying to avoid detection. Also be wary of doors and ladders. These will often emit a sound that may give your position away.<br/><br/><font size='30'>STAY ALIVE</font><br/>Running into a firefight guns blazing will generally get you killed. Savvy players will take cover as often as possible, and use their surroundings to their advantage. Work with your teammates to defeat the enemy.<br/>"
