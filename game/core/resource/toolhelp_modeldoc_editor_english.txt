This value defines the tolerance of how different the position of the foot can be from one frame to the next before it is considered to be moving as part of a step"

This value defines the tolerance of how different the height of the foot can be from one frame to the next and still be considered \"stationary\""

By default, the distance goes from 0 to the distance in bind pose, so be careful with curvy surfaces and bend/torsion springs: they resist going completely flat by default. If you want a very stiff spring, enable advanced parameters and set explicit length. It's set to min=max from binding pose at the time of spring creation with Add Springs wizard."
