		"Attribute.public.occlusion_scale"		"The amount of occlusion to calculate and apply. A 0.0 value indicates no occlusion testing and an guaranteed output of 1.0 (no occlusion). As the value moves towards 1.0 the results of the testing are inversely scaled towards the possibility of full occlusion of 0.0."
