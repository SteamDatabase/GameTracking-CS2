		"clothchain.twist_relax:help"		"<p><b>Experimental</b></p>
<p>The orientation of a bone affected by cloth is usually determined by the closest 3+ cloth vertices/nodes. Sometimes however there are only 1 or 2 vertices available, as for example in case of unextruded ropes/chains. They are the most efficient to simulate, but they don't provide enough information to unambiguously determine bone orientations. In that case, cloth prior to 2022 was taking the root of the chain orientation, and interpolated that along the chain.</p>

<p>Depending on the chain structure, this may cause quick flips of the chains, e.g. tassles that are modeled 90 degrees away from their relaxed state. Sometimes it may cause cloth to ignore twisting motion from animation. For example here is a chain of 3 joints that goes from bottom to top, root at the bottom and the tip (at the top) are both static (not simulating) but with free rotation. When the top is rotated, the chain doesn't twist because it takes the twist from the root, that isn't twisting.</p>

<p>Here is another example of two chains connecing in the middle. The left half is twisted, and the right isn't, and they meet in the middle. The twists are conflicting and have an unpleasant discontinuity in the middle.

<p>Twist Relax attribute is made to distribute the twist along the chain softly. Think of the twist as flowing along the chain, including branches. The Twist Relax amount is how fast it flows. If you have both ends fixed (like in this example), this attribute will flow twist from both ends of the chain and balance out in the middle to create a pleasant falloff.</p>

<p>Stiff Hinge affects all 3 nodes: child, parent and grandparent. It pulls them together along one line, and this scheme resists small bends very well, but doesn't resist large (over 60 degrees) bends very well.</p>

		"clothchain.stiff_hinge_angle:help"		"When you use Stiff Hinge attribute, it can be too stiff.

		"clothchain.motion_bias:help"		"<p>This is made specifically to model chains of old-style Source1 jigglebones that were perfect to model antennae.

But if you want the parent to affect the motion of the child, but child <b>not</b> to affect the parent, set motion bias to 1. This will ensure that motino is traveling down the chain but not up the chain.</p>

<p>When used together with stiff hinge, this attribute ensure perfect stiffness of your antenna joint chain. So perfect that there's no springiness to the antenna at all, it'll be perfectly rigid unless you soften it up somehow. One way to soften it is to set the bias to less than 1 (try 0.5). It will allow some, but not, of the motion to travel up the chain.</p>
<p>Another variant would be to set Stiff Hinge Angle to something small (try 5), and Motion Bias to 1. This will keep the hinges perfectly stiff, but will allow for the bend up to specified angle</p>"
		"clothchain.extra_iterations:help"		"<p>Sometimes springs aren't stiff enough. Setting Extra Iterations to above 0 will effectively add the spring multiple times, so it'll be solved multiple times, so in large systems it will be stiffer.</p>

You can only observe the difference in behavior in a large system, where there are many other springs tugging on cloth so that it makes sense to re-solve this spring after those other springs had the chance to move the joint</p>

<p><b>Use with caution</b>: this will affect performance if used a lot, and you get most of the benefits, if any, with very small numbers like 1 or 2.
